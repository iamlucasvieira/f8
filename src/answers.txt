Yes, definitely.
It is certain.
Without a doubt.
You may rely on it.
As I see it, yes.
Most likely.
Outlook good.
Yes.
Signs point to yes.
Absolutely.
Indeed.
Of course.
Why not?
Sure thing!
The stars align in your favor.
The universe says yes.
No.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.
Don't count on it.
The signs say no.
Absolutely not.
No way.
Unlikely.
The answer is no.
I wouldn't bet on it.
The universe says no.
Reply hazy, try again.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
Cannot predict now.
Concentrate and ask again.
The answer is unclear.
It’s a mystery.
Who knows?
The future is uncertain.
Maybe, maybe not.
Could go either way.
It's 50/50.
Hard to say.
It’s anyone’s guess.
Too soon to tell.
The fates are undecided.
Indeterminate.
The magic is clouded today.
Focus and ask again.
Only time will tell.
Not sure, try again.
