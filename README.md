# f8 🎱 (aka "fate")

**f8** is a lightweight and fun command-line application written in Rust that mimics the classic Magic 8-Ball. Ask any question, and let **f8** decide your fate!

## Features ✨

-   🎲 **Randomized Responses**: Get a unique answer every time you ask a question.
-   🦀 **Rust-Powered**: Built for speed and reliability with Rust.

## Installation 📦

To install **f8**, you’ll need to have Rust installed. If you don’t have Rust, you can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is set up, clone this repository and install **f8** using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamlucasvieira/f8.git
cd f8
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage 🚀

Just type your question after the f8 command:

```text
f8 "Will I get that promotion?"
```

f8 will then respond with a randomly chosen answer, like:

```text
The signs point to yes.
```

And add your custom answers under the `[responses]` section.
